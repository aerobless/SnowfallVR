# SnowfallVR

A game about throwing snowballs at waves of monsters in VR. The game is made to run on a Oculus Quest 1 or 2 headset.

## Installation

1. Download the latest apk artifact from https://github.com/aerobless/SnowfallVR/tree/master/artifacts
2. Use [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/) (recommended), ADB or a similar tool to install the apk on your headset


## Development stack

I'm building the game in Unity 2019.4.7f1 and Jetbrains Rider. The main programming language used is C#. I'm developing on a mac, but the project should work on any system supporting mono and Unity.

## Can I clone this project & build it myself?

Yes, but you'll be missing some art assets. Since I've bought some art assets on the unity store I can't share those on GitHub. They're located in a folder called ThirdPartyAssets. Assets that I made myself or have an open license are located under SixtyMetersAssets. Please see the [license file](https://github.com/aerobless/SnowfallVR/blob/master/SnowfallVR/Assets/SixtyMetersAssets/licenses.md) for records of the individual art assets licenses. If there is no license specified for an asset you should assume it's copyrighted either by myself or others.

All code is my own and you're free to do with it what you want.
